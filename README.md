# binary-takuzu
An unusual Takuzu solver as a puzzle is represented as a binary number. Accordingly, the puzzle is solved by bit manipulation. The project is currently a work-in-progress but I will update this when everything's working.

## TO DO:
- Fix backtracking algorithm
- Write documentation
- Write tests
- Add the option to input your own puzzle as a command-line argument or to automatically generate a new one
- Make a nice build/user-friendly way to use this project
